# Coding-Practice
This repository is basically simple coding problems that I have done in various programming languages

Currently, I have codes in the following:
1. FreCodeCamp: Algorithm based problems in JavaScript
2. Racket Programs: Some basic functions in racket.
3. Project Euler: Coded answers to Project Euler in C++.


I am also planning to add coded solutions to codechef problems and will try to put them in Python or Kotlin
